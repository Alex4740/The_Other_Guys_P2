Sprint Retrospective

    Things done well:
        Organization of our project helped guide our progress
        Time management
        Communication of issues and resolution
        Teamwork was a priority, each member helped each other if needed
        Shared troubleshooting experience

    Things to improve:
        Defect tracking, try to use GitHub Projects issues tracking feature
        Identifying reusable code (string literals and such)
        Naming conventions for front-end could be improved
        Modularize the implementation of the E2E tests to follow front-end as it is completed
            implement step by step through each feature to reduce duplicated steps
